# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall implement MCP protocol v1.0 with backwards compatibility handling for protocol updates.

**FR2:** The system shall provide semantic search capabilities using vector embeddings with configurable embedding models (OpenAI, local sentence-transformers).

**FR3:** The system shall support document ingestion for multiple formats: markdown, plain text, PDF, and structured data (JSON, CSV).

**FR4:** The system shall provide a web-based UI for document upload, search interface, and results visualization.

**FR5:** The system shall expose MCP tools for: document search, document retrieval, and knowledge base querying.

**FR6:** The system shall support incremental document indexing without requiring full re-indexing of the knowledge base.

**FR7:** The system shall implement hybrid search combining semantic similarity and keyword matching with adjustable weighting.

**FR8:** The system shall provide real-time search suggestions and query completion in the UI.

**FR9:** The system shall support document chunking strategies with configurable chunk sizes and overlap settings.

**FR10:** The system shall maintain search history and provide search analytics through the UI.

**FR11:** The system shall support document metadata tagging and filtering capabilities.

**FR12:** The system shall provide export functionality for search results and document collections.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The system shall respond to search queries within 2 seconds for knowledge bases up to 10,000 documents.

**NFR2:** The system shall support concurrent usage by up to 10 users without performance degradation.

**NFR3:** The UI shall be fully responsive and functional on mobile devices with screen widths down to 320px.

**NFR4:** The system shall implement comprehensive logging for all MCP operations and search queries for debugging purposes.

**NFR5:** Embedding costs shall be minimized through caching and local embedding options, targeting <$10/month for typical usage.

**NFR6:** The system shall maintain 99% uptime for MCP server availability during normal operations.

**NFR7:** The system shall implement graceful fallback when vector search fails, using keyword search as backup.

**NFR8:** The system shall support horizontal scaling through modular architecture allowing vector DB swapping.

**NFR9:** All user data and documents shall be processed locally with no external transmission except for optional cloud embeddings.

**NFR10:** The system shall start up and be ready to serve requests within 30 seconds of deployment.
