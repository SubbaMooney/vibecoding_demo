# Technical Risk Management & Mitigation Framework

## Critical Risk Assessment

**RISK 1: MCP Protocol Instability & Breaking Changes**
- **Severity:** HIGH | **Probability:** HIGH | **Impact:** CRITICAL
- **Description:** MCP is an evolving standard with guaranteed protocol instability
- **Mitigation:** Protocol abstraction layer with version compatibility matrix
- **Implementation:** Story 1.2 enhanced with abstraction requirements

**RISK 2: Vector Database Performance** 
- **Status:** ACKNOWLEDGED - Accepting performance risk for initial implementation
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive performance metrics in Story 3.5 and 5.1
- **Future Mitigation:** Architecture allows for vector DB replacement if needed

**RISK 3: Cross-Device State Synchronization Complexity**
- **Severity:** MEDIUM | **Probability:** HIGH | **Impact:** HIGH  
- **Description:** Distributed systems complexity for multi-device continuity
- **Mitigation:** CRDT implementation with eventual consistency model
- **Implementation:** Story 4.6 and 4.7 with conflict resolution architecture

**RISK 4: Accessibility Implementation Overhead**
- **Severity:** MEDIUM | **Probability:** HIGH | **Impact:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** Comprehensive accessibility creates technical complexity
- **Mitigation:** Microservice architecture for accessibility features
- **Implementation:** Story 4.5 with progressive enhancement approach

**RISK 5: User Privacy & Regulatory Compliance**
- **Severity:** HIGH | **Probability:** MEDIUM | **Impact:** CRITICAL
- **Description:** GDPR and privacy regulations conflict with personalization
- **Mitigation:** Privacy-by-design with federated learning architecture
- **Implementation:** Story 4.7 with zero-knowledge personalization

**RISK 6: Mobile PWA Performance Limitations**
- **Severity:** MEDIUM | **Probability:** HIGH | **Impact:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** Browser limitations prevent full RAG functionality on mobile
- **Mitigation:** Progressive feature loading with edge computing support
- **Implementation:** Story 4.6 with hybrid processing model
