# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a modern, intuitive RAG interface that feels like a sophisticated knowledge discovery platform. The UI should balance power-user functionality with approachable design, featuring a clean dashboard for document management, an intelligent search interface with real-time suggestions, and rich visualization of search results and document relationships. The experience should feel responsive and delightful, avoiding the clinical feel of typical database interfaces.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Search-First Experience:** Primary interaction through a prominent, smart search bar with auto-complete and query suggestions
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features hidden behind clean interface, revealed contextually when needed
- **Drag-and-Drop Document Management:** Intuitive file upload with visual feedback and batch processing capabilities
- **Contextual Actions:** Right-click menus and hover states for quick document operations and search refinements
- **Real-time Feedback:** Live search results, upload progress, and processing status with smooth transitions

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard:** Document library overview with search bar, recent queries, and system status
- **Search Results Page:** Rich results display with snippet previews, relevance scoring, and filtering options
- **Document Viewer:** Full document display with highlighting of search matches and metadata panel
- **Upload/Management Interface:** Bulk document upload with processing queue and error handling
- **Settings/Configuration:** Vector model selection, chunking parameters, and system preferences
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Search performance metrics, popular queries, and knowledge base insights

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, high contrast mode support, and semantic HTML structure throughout.

## Branding
Modern, technical aesthetic with dark mode as primary theme. Clean typography (possibly JetBrains Mono for code/technical elements), subtle animations for state changes, and a color scheme emphasizing blues and greens to convey trust and intelligence. Visual elements should suggest interconnected knowledge and semantic relationships.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on desktop browsers for power users, but fully responsive design supporting tablets and mobile devices. Progressive enhancement ensures core functionality works across all device sizes.
