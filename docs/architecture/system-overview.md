# System Overview

## Architecture Style
The MCP RAG Server employs a **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** pattern with **Domain-Driven Design** principles, ensuring:
- Protocol independence through abstraction layers
- Clear separation of business logic from infrastructure
- Testability and maintainability
- Flexibility for technology changes

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Trade-off |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Hexagonal Architecture | MCP protocol instability requires abstraction | Additional complexity |
| CRDT for Synchronization | Automatic conflict resolution for multi-device | Learning curve, implementation complexity |
| Federated Learning | Privacy compliance while enabling personalization | Reduced model accuracy |
| Microservice for Accessibility | Performance isolation for complex features | Additional operational overhead |
| Edge Computing for Mobile | Overcome browser limitations | Infrastructure complexity |
