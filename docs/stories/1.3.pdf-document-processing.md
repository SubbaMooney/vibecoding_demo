# Story 1.3: PDF Document Processing and Storage

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to upload PDF documents that are processed and stored,
**so that** I can search their content through RAG.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **File upload API accepting PDF files (up to 50MB)**
2. **PyPDF2 integration for text extraction from PDFs**
3. **Document metadata storage (filename, page count, text content length)**
4. **Error handling for corrupted or unreadable PDFs**
5. Document listing API with PDF-specific metadata
6. **Text preprocessing (cleaning, normalization) for better search**
7. **Storage organization by document type and upload date**
8. Basic document deletion with file cleanup

  - [ ] Include PDF-specific metadata in responses
  - [ ] Implement document search and filtering capabilities
  - [ ] Create document deletion API with cascade cleanup
  - [ ] Add bulk operations (delete multiple documents)
  - [ ] Implement document status tracking (uploaded, processing, ready, error)

- [ ] Task 6: File storage and organization (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Implement hierarchical storage organization
  - [ ] Create directory structure by document type and date
  - [ ] Add file deduplication capabilities
  - [ ] Implement storage cleanup and archival policies
  - [ ] Create backup and recovery mechanisms
  - [ ] Add storage monitoring and capacity management

- [ ] Task 7: Integration and testing
  - [ ] Integrate with existing MCP server architecture
  - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for all PDF scenarios
  - [ ] Test with various PDF types and sizes
  - [ ] Validate error handling with corrupted files
  - [ ] Performance testing with concurrent uploads
  - [ ] Integration testing with storage systems

## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack for PDF Processing
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-summary.md]

**Document Processing:**
- PyPDF2: Primary PDF text extraction
- python-docx: For Word document support (future)
- markdown-it: For markdown processing
- Fallback libraries: pdfplumber, pymupdf for complex PDFs

**Storage Systems:**
- Object Storage: MinIO/S3 for file storage
- Relational Database: PostgreSQL 15+ for metadata
- Cache: Redis 7+ for processing status and temporary data

### Data Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/data-architecture.md]

**Document Schema:**
```sql
documents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  filename VARCHAR(255),
  original_filename VARCHAR(255),
  file_size BIGINT,
  mime_type VARCHAR(100),
  page_count INTEGER,
  text_content_length BIGINT,
  upload_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  processing_status VARCHAR(50),
  storage_path VARCHAR(500),
  metadata JSONB
)
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specifications.md]

**Upload Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/v1/documents/upload`
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- File size limit: 50MB
- Response: Document metadata with processing status

**Document Management:**
- `GET /api/v1/documents` - List with filters
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}` - Get specific document
- `DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}` - Delete with cleanup

### Container Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

**Integration Points:**
- RAG Engine: Document processing and text extraction
- Object Storage (MinIO): File storage with organized structure
- PostgreSQL: Metadata and document catalog
- API Gateway: RESTful endpoints for document operations

### Error Handling Strategy
- Comprehensive validation at upload
- Graceful degradation for unsupported PDF features
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed logging for debugging

### Storage Organization
```
storage/documents/
├── pdf/
│   └── 2024/
│       └── 09/
│           └── 24/
│               ├── original/     # Original uploaded files
│               ├── processed/    # Extracted text files
│               └── metadata/     # Processing metadata
```

### Testing Standards
**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for PDF extraction functions
- Integration tests for upload/processing workflows
- Performance tests with large files (up to 50MB)
- Error handling tests with corrupted PDFs
- API endpoint testing with various file types
- Storage organization and cleanup testing
