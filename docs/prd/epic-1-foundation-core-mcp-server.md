# Epic 1: Foundation & Core MCP Server

**Epic Goal:** Establish the foundational project infrastructure, implement a functional MCP server with basic RAG capabilities, and create initial document processing to validate the core architecture while delivering testable functionality from day one.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment
As a developer,
I want a fully configured development environment with Docker,
so that I can efficiently develop and test the MCP RAG server with consistent tooling.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure with backend/ and frontend/ directories
2. **Docker Compose setup with Python backend and React frontend services**
3. **Development volumes for hot reloading in both containers**
4. Python 3.11+ with FastAPI, MCP SDK, PyPDF2 dependencies
5. React + TypeScript frontend initialized with Vite
6. **Docker networking configured for backend-frontend communication**
7. **Environment variables and secrets management through Docker**
8. Development scripts: `docker-compose up`, `docker-compose dev`

## Story 1.2: MCP Protocol Abstraction Layer and Server Implementation
As a developer,
I want a robust MCP server with protocol abstraction layer,
so that the system remains stable despite MCP protocol evolution and breaking changes.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **MCP Protocol Abstraction Layer with hexagonal architecture**
   - Protocol-agnostic core RAG domain model
   - Pluggable MCP adapter interface with version compatibility
   - Protocol version detection and compatibility matrix
   - Fallback REST API when MCP is unavailable or incompatible

2. **Version-resilient MCP implementation**
   - Support for multiple MCP protocol versions simultaneously
   - Automatic protocol version negotiation with clients
   - Graceful degradation for unsupported protocol features
   - Protocol migration tools for version upgrades

3. **Comprehensive MCP documentation and testing**
   - Detailed README explaining MCP protocol and abstraction layer
   - Code comments for each message type and version differences
   - Example MCP client scripts for multiple protocol versions
   - Protocol compatibility test suite

4. **FastAPI server with MCP and fallback APIs**
   - MCP protocol implementation through abstraction layer
   - REST/GraphQL API fallback with feature parity
   - WebSocket support for real-time MCP operations
   - Health check endpoints for all protocol adapters

5. **Protocol monitoring and debugging**
   - MCP message flow logging with version information
   - Protocol performance metrics and latency tracking
   - Automatic protocol issue detection and alerting
   - Debug mode with detailed protocol tracing

6. **MCP tool definitions with version management**
   - Version-specific tool schemas for RAG operations
   - Tool capability negotiation based on protocol version
   - Backward compatibility for older tool definitions
   - Tool migration utilities for protocol updates

7. **Protocol change management system**
   - Automated MCP specification monitoring for changes
   - Change impact analysis for protocol updates
   - Version compatibility testing automation
   - Protocol update notification system

8. **Failover and resilience mechanisms**
   - Automatic failover from MCP to REST API
   - Circuit breaker pattern for protocol failures
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Protocol health monitoring and auto-recovery

## Story 1.3: PDF Document Processing and Storage
As a user,
I want to upload PDF documents that are processed and stored,
so that I can search their content through RAG.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **File upload API accepting PDF files (up to 50MB)**
2. **PyPDF2 integration for text extraction from PDFs**
3. **Document metadata storage (filename, page count, text content length)**
4. **Error handling for corrupted or unreadable PDFs**
5. Document listing API with PDF-specific metadata
6. **Text preprocessing (cleaning, normalization) for better search**
7. **Storage organization by document type and upload date**
8. Basic document deletion with file cleanup

## Story 1.4: Simple Vector Embedding and Search
As a user,
I want to perform basic semantic search on uploaded documents,
so that I can validate the RAG functionality works end-to-end.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Qdrant integration for distributed-ready vector storage
2. Document chunking with fixed-size chunks (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
3. Sentence-transformers embedding model integration
4. Basic search API endpoint accepting query text
5. Return top-K similar chunks with similarity scores
6. MCP tool for document search exposed through server
7. Search results include document source and chunk context
8. Basic error handling for embedding and search failures

## Story 1.5: Polished Web Interface for Testing
As a user,
I want a well-designed web interface for document management and search,
so that I can effectively test and demonstrate the RAG system.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Modern React UI with Mantine design system styling**
2. **Drag-and-drop PDF upload with progress indicators**
3. **Document library with thumbnails and metadata display**
4. **Search interface with real-time query suggestions**
5. **Search results with PDF page references and snippets**
6. **Dark theme with responsive design for mobile/desktop**
7. **Error states and loading animations throughout**
8. **Docker-served production build of React app**
