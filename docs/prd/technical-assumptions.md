# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing both the MCP server backend and the web UI frontend, enabling coordinated development and shared tooling while maintaining clear separation of concerns through workspace structure.

## Service Architecture
**Hybrid Architecture:** Core MCP server as a focused service with embedded web server for UI hosting. The MCP server handles RAG operations while serving the web interface, avoiding the complexity of microservices for this focused application while maintaining modularity through clean internal separation.

## Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests for RAG operations and MCP protocol handling, plus integration tests for the complete MCP server workflow. Manual testing convenience methods for UI validation and document processing scenarios, given the visual and interactive nature of the search interface.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
