# Epic 0: User Experience Foundation

**Epic Goal:** Establish user-centered design principles, validate user personas and workflows, and create foundational UX research to guide all subsequent development decisions.

## Story 0.1: User Research & Persona Validation
As a product team,
I want comprehensive user research and validated personas,
so that all development decisions are grounded in real user needs and behaviors.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Primary user persona identification through user interviews**
   - Conduct 15-20 user interviews with potential RAG system users
   - Identify primary personas: researchers, analysts, knowledge workers
   - Document pain points, workflows, and success criteria for each persona
   - Validate assumptions about search behavior and document interaction patterns

2. **User journey mapping for core RAG workflows**
   - Map end-to-end journey for "Find specific information" use case
   - Document journey for "Explore related concepts" workflow
   - Identify touchpoints, emotions, and friction points in current solutions
   - Create opportunity maps for UX improvements

3. **Competitive UX analysis of existing RAG/search tools**
   - Analyze UX patterns in tools like Notion AI, ChatGPT with documents, Obsidian
   - Document effective design patterns and anti-patterns
   - Identify differentiation opportunities for superior user experience
   - Benchmark user satisfaction and task completion rates

4. **Accessibility requirements gathering**
   - Interview users with disabilities about document search needs
   - Document accessibility requirements beyond WCAG AA compliance
   - Identify assistive technology compatibility requirements
   - Establish inclusive design principles for the project

5. **Mobile usage pattern research**
   - Study how users currently access documents and search on mobile
   - Identify mobile-specific RAG use cases and workflows
   - Document constraints and opportunities for mobile RAG interfaces
   - Validate mobile-first vs desktop-first design strategy

6. **Success metrics definition and validation**
   - Define user-centered success metrics (time to insight, task completion)
   - Validate metrics with users through card sorting and prioritization
   - Establish baseline measurements from current user workflows
   - Create measurement framework for ongoing UX optimization

7. **Information architecture validation through card sorting**
   - Conduct open and closed card sorting with target users
   - Validate navigation structure and feature organization
   - Test mental models for search, document organization, and analytics
   - Document IA decisions with user research backing

8. **Usability testing framework establishment**
   - Create standardized usability testing protocols
   - Establish user testing lab (remote and in-person capabilities)
   - Define testing cadence and participant recruitment strategy
   - Document testing results communication and integration process
