# Next Steps

## UX Architecture & Research Prompt
*"Please create a comprehensive UX research plan and interface architecture based on this enhanced PRD. Focus on validating the user personas defined in Epic 0, creating detailed user journey maps for the progressive disclosure patterns in Epic 4, and establishing the usability testing framework for continuous UX optimization. Include wireframes for the mobile-first responsive design and accessibility testing protocols."*

## Technical Architecture Prompt
*"Please review this enhanced MCP RAG Server PRD and create a detailed technical architecture document. Focus on the Python/FastAPI + React/TypeScript + Qdrant stack, MCP protocol implementation, user personalization data architecture, accessibility technical requirements, and production deployment architecture. Include specific considerations for the mobile PWA requirements and cross-device synchronization outlined in the UX enhancements."*

## Implementation Roadmap Prompt
*"Based on this comprehensive PRD, create a phased implementation roadmap that prioritizes user research and foundational UX work (Epic 0) before technical development. Include UX validation checkpoints throughout the development process, accessibility testing integration, and user feedback collection at each epic milestone."*
