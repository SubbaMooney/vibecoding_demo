# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a fully configured development environment with Docker,
**so that** I can efficiently develop and test the MCP RAG server with consistent tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure with backend/ and frontend/ directories
2. **Docker Compose setup with Python backend and React frontend services**
3. **Development volumes for hot reloading in both containers**
4. Python 3.11+ with FastAPI, MCP SDK, PyPDF2 dependencies
5. React + TypeScript frontend initialized with Vite
6. **Docker networking configured for backend-frontend communication**
7. **Environment variables and secrets management through Docker**
8. Development scripts: `docker-compose up`, `docker-compose dev`

## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack Details
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-summary.md]

**Backend Stack:**
- Language: Python 3.11+
- Frameworks: FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- MCP SDK: Anthropic MCP Python SDK
- ML/AI: Sentence-Transformers, LangChain, PyTorch
- Document Processing: PyPDF2, python-docx, markdown-it

**Frontend Stack:**
- Framework: React 18+ with TypeScript
- UI Library: Mantine v7+
- State Management: Zustand with CRDT support
- Build Tool: Vite
- PWA: Workbox for service workers

**Infrastructure Stack:**
- Container: Docker, Kubernetes
- Testing: Pytest, Jest, Playwright
- Code Quality: Black, ESLint, Prettier, mypy
- Version Control: Git with GitFlow
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

### Container Architecture
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#container-architecture]

The system uses a multi-container architecture with the following key services:
- Web Application: React/TypeScript (Progressive Web App)
- API Gateway: FastAPI (REST/GraphQL/WebSocket endpoints)
- MCP Server: Python (MCP protocol handler with abstraction layer)
- RAG Engine: Python (Document processing and search)

For this initial story, we're setting up the foundation for the Web Application and API Gateway containers.

### Deployment Considerations
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

While the full system uses Kubernetes for production, this story focuses on Docker Compose for local development. The Docker setup should mirror the production container architecture as closely as possible to ensure smooth deployment later.

### Project Structure Requirements
No specific unified project structure document was found in architecture docs. The monorepo structure should follow standard conventions:
```
/
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── requirements.txt
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   └── package.json
├── shared/
├── docs/
└── docker-compose.yml
```

### Testing Standards
**Testing Requirements:**
- Backend: Use Pytest for Python testing
- Frontend: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- Test files should be co-located with source files or in dedicated tests/ directories
- Aim for 80% code coverage minimum
- All API endpoints must have integration tests
