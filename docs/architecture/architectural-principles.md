# Architectural Principles

## 1. Protocol Agnosticism
- Core domain logic independent of MCP protocol
- Pluggable adapters for protocol versions
- Fallback mechanisms for protocol failures

## 2. Privacy-by-Design
- Data minimization at every layer
- Client-side processing when possible
- Encrypted data transmission and storage
- User consent at feature level

## 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality without JavaScript
- Advanced features as optional layers
- Graceful degradation for limited devices
- Accessibility as base requirement

## 4. Eventual Consistency
- CRDT-based conflict resolution
- Offline-first architecture
- Asynchronous synchronization
- Device-specific state isolation
