# MCP RAG Server Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) compliant server that provides RAG capabilities with robust fallback mechanisms
- Create a sophisticated yet performant user interface optimized for RAG workflows and mobile responsiveness
- Enable semantic search and retrieval across indexed documents with hybrid search capabilities
- Provide developers with well-documented MCP tools to integrate RAG into their AI workflows
- Support scalable document ingestion, indexing, and intelligent retrieval with incremental updates
- Implement cost-effective embedding strategies with local model options
- Establish comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities for RAG quality

### Background Context
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) is Anthropic's evolving open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools. By creating an MCP server with RAG capabilities, this project will enable AI assistants like Claude to access custom knowledge bases through semantic search. Given MCP's relative newness, we'll build with modular architecture to adapt to protocol changes. The "fancy UI" requirement demands a modern interface that balances sophistication with performance, providing visualization and management capabilities while avoiding over-engineering that could hurt usability.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a modern, intuitive RAG interface that feels like a sophisticated knowledge discovery platform. The UI should balance power-user functionality with approachable design, featuring a clean dashboard for document management, an intelligent search interface with real-time suggestions, and rich visualization of search results and document relationships. The experience should feel responsive and delightful, avoiding the clinical feel of typical database interfaces.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
